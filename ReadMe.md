# Text Editor Web Application

This is a text editor web application that provides various features such as bundling with webpack, IndexedDB storage, service worker registration, and deployment scripts for Render.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-editor-app.git

    Navigate to the root directory of the project:

    bash
   ```

cd text-editor-app

Install dependencies using npm:

bash

npm install

Start the application:

bash

    npm run start

Folder Structure

The application follows a client-server folder structure:

arduino

text-editor-app/
├── client/ # Client-side code (HTML, CSS, JS)
├── server/ # Server-side code (Node.js, Express)
└── webpack.config.js # Webpack configuration file

Features

    Webpack Bundling: JavaScript files are bundled using webpack for optimized performance.
    IndexedDB Storage: Utilizes IndexedDB for client-side storage, ensuring saved content persists across sessions.
    Service Worker: A service worker is registered using Workbox, providing offline functionality and caching static assets.
    Deployment Scripts: Includes proper build scripts for deployment to Render or other hosting platforms.

Usage

    Open the text editor application in your preferred editor.
    Run npm run start from the root directory to start the backend and serve the client.
    Use next-gen JavaScript for the application, ensuring it functions without errors.
    Content entered in the text editor is saved and retrieved from IndexedDB.
    Click the Install button to download the web application as an icon on your desktop.
    Load the web application to have a registered service worker with pre-cached static assets.

Deployment

To deploy the application to Render:

    Configure your Render account and set up a new web service.
    Update the deployment settings in webpack.config.js if necessary.
    Run the deployment script:

    bash

    npm run deploy
